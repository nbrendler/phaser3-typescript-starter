# Phaser3 Typescript template

This is a template for a new Phaser3 project using Typescript and a working
prod/dev setup.

It's adapted from the [official Phaser template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-typescript-project-template).

The general command structure is inspired by the default preact-cli setup.

## Development

```
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve
```
